# OList Exploratory data analysis

To view the queries, please click on 'sql_queries.ipynb'

Hey! First of all, thanks for taking the time to look at this github repo of my SQL queries. My intention here is to just show some of my abilities with github, SQL, and python. 

This repo is currently incomplete as there are a few more things I would like to complete, such as:
- Automating the dataflow into my tableau dashboard with a view
- Answering a few more descriptive analytics questions
- Provide a bit more detail with my data visualisation in python

If you wish to see my tableau dashboard, please head over to here!

Please feel free to shoot me an email or text should you have any questions about what I have completed so far!
