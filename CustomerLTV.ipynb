    "Customer lifetime value is a measure of total income a business can expect to bring in from a typical customer as long as they remain a client [1]. This leads to the question of how we can improve customer retention and increase a customer's life time values. There are several reasons to measure customer lifetime value:\n",
    "- We do not know what we do not measure, that is, if we don't understand how much on average a customer spends with us, we will not be able to address features regarding it\n",
    "- If we are able to retain customers for longer, then we should be able to provide more personalised services, leading to a cascasde effect where people are more likely to spend more for a better service."
